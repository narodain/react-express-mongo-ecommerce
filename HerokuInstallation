First this repo has a few months and the package.json file needs an update, add this file the following pair of key values
"engines": {
    "node": "> = 11.0.0",
    "npm": "> = 6.0.0"
  }

Second also note that version 4.4.0 of the dependency react-router-dom is no longer found
you need to update the package.json file
from the client folder and update the version to 5.1.2
 "react-router-dom": "^ 5.1.2"

Third you must create a database in mlab
https://mlab.com/
In the DB folder I provide you with json files that represent the collections in the database, try to import these files.
I used robo3t to connect to mlab and import

Finally, you need to provide Heroku with your own environment variable configuration; Mine doesn't work for you.
in the config folder are the environment variables
module.exports = {
    MONGO_URI: process.env.MONGO_URI,
    JWT_SECRET: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    JWT_SECRET_CART: process.env.JWT_SECRET_CART,
    PAYPAL_MODE: process.env.PAYPAL_MODE,
    PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID,
    PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET,
    PAYPAL_API: process.env.PAYPAL_API,
    RETURN_URL: process.env.RETURN_URL,
    CANCEL_URL: process.env.CANCEL_URL
}
On tab settings cklick on Reveal Config Vars button

And then
on heroku don't put any quote ' ' or doble quote " "

MONGO_URI: "mongodb://YOUR-MLAB-db", like this  "mongodb://your_user:your_password@xxxx.mlab.com:xxxx/your_db_name"
JWT_SECRET: "YOUR-SUPER-SECRET-KEY",
JWT_SECRET_CART: "YOUR-SUPER-SECRET-CART-KEY",
PAYPAL_MODE: "sandbox",
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID: "YOUR-PAYPAL-CLIENT-ID",
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET: "YOUR-PAYPAL-CLIENT-SECRET",
PAYPAL_API: "https://api.sandbox.paypal.com",
RETURN_URL: "https://your-heroku-app-name.herokuapp.com/payment",
CANCEL_URL: "https://your-heroku-app-name.herokuapp.com"


I hope, helped you. Thank you.
